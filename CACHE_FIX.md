# GitHub Pages Cache Issue - How to See New Styles

The styles have been updated and pushed to GitHub. If you're not seeing the changes, try these steps:

## 1. Hard Refresh Your Browser
- **Chrome/Edge (Windows)**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Chrome/Edge (Mac)**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R`

## 2. Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser settings
2. Clear browsing data/cache
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data
5. Refresh the page

## 3. Wait for GitHub Pages to Rebuild
GitHub Pages can take 1-5 minutes to rebuild after a push. Check:
- Go to your repository: https://github.com/candicesxc/Profile-to-Profile-Outreach-Engine
- Click on "Actions" tab
- Verify the latest deployment completed successfully

## 4. Check the CSS File Directly
Visit: https://candicesxc.github.io/Profile-to-Profile-Outreach-Engine/styles.css?v=2

You should see the new LinkedIn-style CSS with:
- `background: #f3f2ef;` (light gray background)
- `color: #0a66c2;` (LinkedIn blue)
- `.card` styles with white backgrounds
- New button styles

## 5. Verify GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Verify:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
   - If it shows a different branch, change it to `main` and save

## What Changed
The new styles include:
- LinkedIn-inspired color scheme (#0a66c2 blue, #f3f2ef background)
- Card-based layout with white surfaces
- Professional button styles
- Better typography and spacing
- Hero section on the outreach page
- Progress bars and copy buttons

If you still don't see the changes after trying all these steps, let me know!
